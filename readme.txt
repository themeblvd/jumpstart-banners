Restores the banner functionality from Jump Start v2.0, when updating to v2.1+.

== Description ==

The [Jump Start](http://wpjumpstart.com) theme had a feature for adding banners to pages and posts in v2.0. However, in v2.1 this feature was removed in favor of a better system of implementing featured image for a similar effect. For those that want to continue relying on that feature, this plugin restores the banner feature in Jump Start 2.1+.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `jumpstart-banners` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use the "Banners" meta box when editing a post or page.
